              <h3>Founded in 1982, Children’s Creative Corner Co-operative Nursery School
is in the heart of Bloor West Village.
</h3>
              <p>In 1976 Carolyn MacKay, head of the Family Studies Department at Western Technical-Commercial School, founded a pre-school program with the support of Principal Barry Stroud. One of the driving motivations was to provide Family Studies students with the opportunity to learn by active participation with children in a play environment.</p>

<p>An empty classroom was transformed into a play school and children were recruited by means of an advertisement in The Villager (Bloor West) and fliers posted throughout the area. There was great demand for spaces in the school from this baby-boomer neighbourhood. The play school was held every morning for three weeks in the fall and three weeks in the spring. This proved to be the forerunner of our Co-operative.</p>

<p>In 1982, under the leadership of Principal Barry Stroud, the staff at Western Technical-Commercial School generously offered to share their talents and resources with the new Co-operative. After much negotiation and hard work, the play school evolved into Children’s Creative Corner Co-operative Nursery School, which operates and functions entirely separately from Western Technical Commercial School.</p>

              <h3>“Learning through the power of play”</h3>
              <p>Children’s Creative Corner Co-operative Nursery School is a non-competitive environment, which offers a varied and stimulating play experience for children. In a comfortable and stimulating group setting, children are offered the opportunity to make a smooth transition from the home to the community.</p>

<p>The primary goal of our school is to encourage individuality in our children, allowing them to grow, to create and to learn so that they will develop the confidence and the ability to take risks. The development of skills is taught within the context of this goal.</p>

              <p>Creative Corners Co-operative Nursery School recognizes the value of parental involvement in a child’s learning experience and a co-op is one type of school that offers parents/caregivers many opportunities to participate in their children’s education.</p>
              <p>Each member actively contributes to the school as a member of either the elected Executive or part of a committee (fundraising, or social etc.), or has an individual responsibility (play dough making, laundry etc.).</p>

<p>Members are also required to do duty days, which entails assisting the teachers in the classroom approximately once a month (2 Morning Program) and twice a month (3 Morning Program) and three times per month (Extended Kindergarten Preparation Program). Our 2 Afternoon Program does not require members to do duty days.</p>

<p>More information about our program and parent/caregiver involvement can be found in our Parent Handbook.</p>
